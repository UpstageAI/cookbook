    "## Financial Analysis over 10-K documents\n",
    "In the world of finance, extracting critical insights from lengthy documents like 10-K forms is an essential but often time-consuming task for analysts. The 10-K form is an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which provides a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance. These documents can run hundreds of pages and are filled with complex, domain-specific terminology. To address this challenge, we showcase how Upstage, combined with LangChain and Chroma, can assist financial analysts in quickly extracting and synthesizing insights from a document with minimal coding effort.\n",

    "This cookbook focuses on Prompt Engineering for Financial Contexts, specifically tailored to extract and analyze financial information from 10-K documents using Upstage, LangChain, and Chroma."
