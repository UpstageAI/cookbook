        "In the world of finance, extracting critical insights from lengthy documents like 10-K forms is an essential but often time-consuming task for analysts. The 10-K form is an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which provides a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance. These documents can run hundreds of pages and are filled with complex, domain-specific terminology. To address this challenge, we showcase how Upstage, combined with LangChain and Chroma, can assist financial analysts in quickly extracting and synthesizing insights from a document with minimal coding effort.\n",

The context also mentions inflation risk, but it does not provide specific details about the company's exposure to inflation risk.\n",
