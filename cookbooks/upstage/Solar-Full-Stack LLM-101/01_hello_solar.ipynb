    "## Overview  \n",
    "In this exercise, we will introduce Solar, a large language model (LLM) framework by Upstage. This initial notebook will cover the basics of setting up Solar, understanding its core components, and running a simple \"Hello, World!\" example to demonstrate its basic functionality.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Purpose of the Exercise\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize users with the Solar LLM framework. By the end of this tutorial, users will have a fundamental understanding of how to initialize and run Solar, preparing them for more advanced tasks and applications in subsequent exercises. This introductory example serves as a foundation for leveraging Solar's capabilities in various NLP tasks."
