    "\n",
    "## Overview  \n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore prompt engineering within the Solar framework. Prompt engineering is a crucial technique in leveraging large language models effectively by crafting prompts that elicit the desired responses from the model. This tutorial will walk you through various strategies for creating and refining prompts to optimize the performance of Solar in different NLP tasks.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Purpose of the Exercise\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to equip users with practical skills in prompt engineering. By the end of this tutorial, users will be able to design effective prompts, understand the impact of prompt variations, and enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses generated by the Solar LLM. This foundational knowledge is essential for advanced applications and fine-tuning of language models.\n"
