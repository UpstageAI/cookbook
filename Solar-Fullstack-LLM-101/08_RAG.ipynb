    "In this exercise, we will explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Solar framework. RAG combines retrieval-based techniques with generative models to improve the relevance and accuracy of generated responses by leveraging external knowledge sources. This notebook will guide you through implementing RAG and demonstrating its benefits in enhancing model outputs.\n",

    "The purpose of this exercise is to integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation into the Solar framework. By the end of this tutorial, users will understand how to use RAG to access external information and generate more informed and contextually accurate responses, thereby improving the performance and reliability of the language model.\n",

James Whitehead Jr., Member, IEEE, and Yi Zhang, Member, IEEE</p><p id='4' style='font-size:14px'>Abstract-This paper introduces a new technique for predicting latent software bugs, called change classification. Change<br>classification uses a machine learning classifier to determine whether a new software change is more similar to prior buggy changes or<br>clean changes. In this manner, change classification predicts the existence of bugs in software changes. The classifier is trained using<br>features (in the machine learning sense) extracted from the revision history of a software project stored in its software configuration<br>management repository. The trained classifier can classify changes as buggy or clean, with a 78 percent accuracy and a 60 percent<br>buggy change recall on average. Change classification has several desirable qualities: 1) "
