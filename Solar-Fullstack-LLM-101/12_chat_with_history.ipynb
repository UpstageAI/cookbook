    "\n",
    "## Overview  \n",
    "This exercise demonstrates the implementation of a question-answering system that utilizes user conversation history. It constructs a chain to generate appropriate responses to user questions based on previous conversation records. Additionally, it allows for more precise question-answering tasks by providing specific context.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Purpose of the Exercise\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to enhance the ability to manage questions and responses using conversation history. By the end of this tutorial, users will understand how to create a system that uses past interactions to inform current responses, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of the answers provided.\n"
