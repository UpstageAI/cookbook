    "In this exercise, we will use the Solar API for translation and summarization. By applying the LLM Chain techniques we have previously learned, we can generate summaries in the desired format and translate English to Korean using the Solar Translation API. This tutorial will guide you through the process of combining summarization and translation effectively.\n",

    "## Purpose of the Exercise\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to attain proficiency in utilizing the LLM Chain and modify output formats by applying prompt engineering techniques. By the end of this tutorial, users will be able to create summaries and translate text seamlessly, improving their ability to manage multilingual content using the Solar API.\n"
