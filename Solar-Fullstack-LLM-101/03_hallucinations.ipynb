    "# 03. Hallucinations\n",
    "## Overview  \n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore the concept of hallucinations in large language models using the Solar framework. Hallucinations refer to instances where the model generates information that is not based on the input data or is factually incorrect. This notebook will help you understand why hallucinations occur and how to mitigate them to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the model's outputs.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Purpose of the Exercise\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to identify and address the issue of hallucinations in language models. By the end of this tutorial, users will be able to recognize hallucinations, understand their causes, and apply strategies to minimize their occurrence, thereby improving the trustworthiness and usability of the Solar LLM.\n"
