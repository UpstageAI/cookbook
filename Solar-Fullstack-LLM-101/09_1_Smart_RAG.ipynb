Smart RAG enhances the standard RAG approach by incorporating intelligent retrieval mechanisms to select the most relevant and high-quality information from external sources. This notebook will guide you through implementing Smart RAG and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n",

        "### High-Level Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The code demonstrates a smart Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines local retrieval with external search capabilities. The main goal is to provide relevant context for answering user questions by first searching a local vector database and then falling back to an external search service if the local context is insufficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The code defines two main functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. is_in: Determines whether the answer to a given question can be found within the provided context.\n",
        "smart_rag: Retrieves relevant context for a given question, either from the local vector database or an external search service, and generates an answer using the retrieved context.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. The code uses the LangChain library for generating prompts and invoking language models, as well as the Tavily API for external search capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detailed Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The code starts by defining the is_in function, which takes a question and context as input and determines whether the answer to the question can be found within the context.\n",
        "    * It defines a prompt template called is_in_conetxt that asks the language model to check if the answer is in the context and return \"yes\" or \"no\".\n",
        "    * The prompt template is used to create a ChatPromptTemplate object.\n",
        "    * A chain of operations is constructed using the | operator:\n",
        "      * The ChatPromptTemplate is passed to the ChatUpstage model.\n",
        "      * The model's output is parsed using the StrOutputParser.\n",
        "    * The chain is invoked with the question and context, and the response is stored in the response variable.\n",
        "    * The function returns True if the response starts with \"yes\" (case-insensitive), indicating that the answer is in the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The code then demonstrates the usage of the is_in function with two example questions and their corresponding contexts retrieved from a retriever.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Next, the code defines the smart_rag function, which takes a question as input and generates an answer using the retrieved context.\n",
        "    * It first retrieves the context for the question using the retriever.invoke method.\n",
        "    * If the is_in function determines that the answer is not in the retrieved context, it falls back to searching for additional context using the Tavily API.\n",
        "    * The retrieved context (either from the local retriever or Tavily) is stored in the context variable.\n",
        "    * A chain of operations is constructed using the | operator:\n",
        "      * The rag_with_history_prompt (not shown in the code snippet) is used as the prompt template.\n",
        "      * The prompt is passed to the llm language model.\n",
        "      * The model's output is parsed using the StrOutputParser.\n",
        "    * The chain is invoked with the conversation history, retrieved context, and the question, and the generated answer is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Finally, the code demonstrates the usage of the smart_rag function with two example questions:\n",
        "    * \"What is DUS?\": The answer is expected to be found in the local context.\n",
        "    * \"What's the population of San Francisco?\": The answer is not expected to be found in the local context, so it falls back to searching with Tavily.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code showcases how LangChain can be used to build a smart RAG system that combines local retrieval with external search capabilities. By first searching a local vector database and falling back to an external search service if needed, the system aims to provide relevant context for generating accurate answers to user questions."
